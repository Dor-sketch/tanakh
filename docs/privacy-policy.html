    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Tanakh. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any data that we may collect. This privacy policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information through our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Tanakh does not collect any personal information from its users. We do not require you to create an account or provide any personal details to use our app.</p>

    <h2>Usage Data</h2>
    <p>We use Google Analytics to collect standard usage statistics about how our app is used. This information is anonymized and does not personally identify individual users. The data collected may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>App installation and uninstallation events</li>
        <li>App crash reports</li>
        <li>General usage patterns (e.g., which features are used most frequently)</li>
        <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information helps us understand how our app is being used and allows us to improve the user experience.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>As we do not collect any personal information, there is no user-specific data stored on our servers.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. The content and features of Tanakh are suitable for general audiences, including children, but we do not target our app specifically to children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
